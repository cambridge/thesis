# Code of Conduct

Firstly, please make sure you read the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/). We're trying to follow this code of conduct as best we can. We would encourage you to follow it too.


# Reporting Bugs

Open an issue and describe the problem in the description of the issue.


# Requesting New Features

Open an issue and describe the desired feature in the description of the issue.


# Contributing Code

You don't have to open an issue if you already have some code to contribute. Just do the following:

1. Open a pull request.
1. Make sure that the build passes (look out for the green tickmark).
1. Check that the PDFs have been build correctly. You will find the PDFs on [BinTray](https://dl.bintray.com/matej/cam-thesis/). The name of your files will be suffixed with short hashes of your commits: `*-<short commit hash>.pdf`
1. Address all the comments.
1. Wait until maintainers merge your pull request.

That's it. Happy coding!
