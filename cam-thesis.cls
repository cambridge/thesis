%% General Cambridge guidelines.
%%
%% LIMIT: 60k words (including tables and footnotes, excluding appendices, bib,
%% photos, diagrams); title and section headings should be capitalized as normal
%% sentences; citations should include authors' initials, and page numbers (if
%% possible); double-sided printing is permissible for the soft bound version;
%% however, single-sided is required for the text of the final, hard bound
%% library copy (diagrams on facing pages are acceptable); always make it
%% possible to create the ps file as well (required for technical reports).
